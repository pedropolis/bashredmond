	BASH scripts for running REDis based MONitoring Daemon

		A set of simple scripts for reporting and monitoring system information
		on a local network. Not a replacement for realtime monioring but not 
		a terrible substitute, better than logging in to each machine with ssh!

		USAGE
			reader.sh [arg]

		EXAMPLES
			reader.sh myhostname
			reader.sh all
			reader.sh ping
			reader.sh help
		
		A single argument must be passed to the script, this may be:
		help
			Shows this help file

		all
			Shows brief vital statistics for all hostnames in the database

		[hostname]
			Shows all info collected for the given hostname 
			(host is checked against the db first and rejected if there is no info)

		ping
			Pings each hostname in the db twice and returns the average ping time	
			(useful to check which hosts are live and should be reporting)
